# IBM Data Science Capstone Project

This repository contains the capstone project I completed as part of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate. The project focuses on various aspects of data collection, wrangling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and machine learning. It includes a series of Jupyter notebooks and other resources that showcase my skills and knowledge in data science.

---

## Project Overview

The project explores several key topics and skills in data science, including:

- Data collection using APIs and web scraping.
- Data wrangling and cleaning.
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) using visualization tools.
- Interactive visualizations with Plotly Dash and Folium.
- Machine learning predictions.
- SQL-based data exploration.
- Working with stock data and other datasets.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ritalee1/IBM-Data-Science-Capstone-Project.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
  cd IBM-Data-Science-Capstone-Project

3. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
  python -m venv env
  source env/bin/activate       # On macOS/Linux
  env\Scripts\activate          # On Windows

4. Install the required Python libraries:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

5. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
  jupyter notebook

Usage
Open any of the .ipynb files in Jupyter Notebook.
Follow the step-by-step instructions in the notebooks to explore data collection, EDA, visualization, and machine learning workflows.
